# BashChat
A Terminal based chat software in which a user can enter a ip and port to connect to and chat over.

<<<TO USE BASH CHAT YOU WILL NEED PYTHON INSTALLED (not entirely sure the minimal python version quite yet, but something near latest, most likely 3.9 or above!)>>>

To use BashChat, download the client.py file and run it, then aquire a code (ip and port) from wherever you get them from and enjoy.

For more instructions please visit the wiki, for things like server hosting or troubleshooting of the client!
